# 📚 Odin Library App

A simple digital library app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. Users can add books they've read (or want to read), mark them as read/unread, and remove them from the collection.

## ✨ Features

- 📖 Add books with title, author, page count, and read status
- ✅ Toggle read/unread status with a single button
- 🗑️ Remove books from your library
- 🎨 Clean UI with responsive card-based layout
- 📦 All data stored in-memory (array), no backend or localStorage used
